Mannequin used to be a Scarecrow in the village where he had nobody to have a decent conversation. He was of use for a poor old lady, he scared a ton of birds, pests and thieves. Unfortunately, she had died and Mannequin's life went on the lonely and hungry spree.

Nihil once found a story on the web of the fisherman who had seen some covered in blood Scarecrow, whose mouth had a bird inside who which had been trying to break free.

The old man though the the poor bird had been probably stuck inside the bizarre Scarecrow. He came to save the creature or at least put it out of misery. To his surprise the skin of his own leg was severely cut when he tried to do so. That was probably the wind, but it seemed as if Scarecrow made a jest with his hand to tell the man 'Go away.'

People was mocking of the man, they thought the fisherman was just drunk or made it all up. The man was shouting curses about the so-called Old WItch that owned the house with the bloody Scarecrow. He even went as far as to post his story on the Paranormal Forum that Nihil hosted.

That is how the Scarequin arrived to the Nihil's home. The pet loves chicken and guards Necromancer's home while he sleeps.
